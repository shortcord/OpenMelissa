## OpenMelissa
----
This was created as a side project while I was working to better understand Melissa's on-premise solutions.

I'm making it public in the hopes that it helps someone else with either understanding what Melissa offers or build a product to use Melissa's offerings more effectively.

Please view the issues and milestones to get a better understanding of what is working and what is missing, feel free to messabout with the source.
